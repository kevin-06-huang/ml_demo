The project involves analyzing data from Embers, a non-profit temp staffing agency that works with marginalized individuals. The goal is to improve the organization's dispatch and assignment process using data-driven insights.
The project uses a Microsoft SQL database, which is accessed through TempsPlus, a legacy program that lacks analytical capabilities.
The six tables analyzed include applicants, customers, history, summary, placements, and orders.
A hypothesis is proposed that profitability can be predicted by analyzing customer attributes.
